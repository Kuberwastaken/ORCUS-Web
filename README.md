## Mission
ORCUS' mission is to address the growing issue of AI-generated content, particularly on platforms like LinkedIn, where AI generated comments fill up the discussion without adding significantly to the original post or conversation.

These automated responses often overshadow genuine human engagement, contributing to a superficial online environment that diminishes the quality of discourse.

ORCUS strives to foster a cultural shift. By encouraging digital literacy and active participation, the project aims to reshape online spaces, restore trust, and ensure that social media remains a platform for thoughtful, original interactions where human creativity and insight are celebrated over automated, generic outputs, without much thought to it.
